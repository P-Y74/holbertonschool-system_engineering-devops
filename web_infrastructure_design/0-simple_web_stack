# Simple One-Server Web Infrastructure

This diagram shows a single server web infrastructure for the website `www.foobar.com`:

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% User sends a request
    User[User] -->|HTTP/HTTPS request| DNS["www#46;foobar#46;com (A record to 8.8.8.8)"]

    %% DNS directs user to the server
    DNS --> Server[Single Server]

    %% Components inside the server
    Server --> WebServer[Nginx Web Server]
    WebServer --> AppServer[Application Server]
    AppServer --> AppFiles["Application Files (Code Base)"]
    AppServer --> DB[MySQL Database]
```

## Explanation

1. **User**: The person who wants to access `www.foobar.com`.
2. **DNS**: Resolves the domain name `www.foobar.com` to the server IP `8.8.8.8` (A record).
3. **Server**: A single machine hosting all components.
4. **Web Server (Nginx)**: Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests, serves static content, and forwards requests to the application server.
5. **Application Server**: Processes the business logic of the application.
6. **Application Files**: Code base stored on the server.
7. **Database (MySQL)**: Stores persistent data for the application.

## Issues with this setup

* **SPOF (Single Point of Failure)**: If the server goes down, the website is completely unavailable.
* **Downtime during maintenance**: Updating code or restarting the web server will cause service interruptions.
* **Scalability**: Cannot handle very high traffic; performance depends on the single server.
